    Calculates the optical flow between two images.

    Initialized Values:
        minimum feature quality (defines the minimum acceptable quality of feature matches),
        feature_threshold (the number of features that we want. The algorithm will try to continue tracking the same
            features throughout the process, but gets rid of bad ones. If the total number of tracked features falls
            below this value, it will trigger another full feature search).

    Input: Previous image @ self.prev_gray, current image @ context['current_frame'], previous points @ self.prev_points,
    Output: (Old, New) lists of matching point pairs. (Old[i], New[i]) are matched point pairs.
